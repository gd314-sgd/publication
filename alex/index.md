# MICA Graphic Design Department Identity

(Work in progress!)

Brand identities rarely have sustainability in mind because 

Assigned by head of the graphic design department, Brockett Horne, I was tasked to create a cohesive visual identity for the department for use on materials such as: signage, online presence and printed collateral. I was given full creativity on the direction of the identity other than 2 requirements: it must relate to the diverse identity of the department and must be “memorable.”

From the beginning I wanted to focus on sustainability and if it can be incorporated into a identity system. In order to full commit to the theme, I set up 2 restrictions: no vinyl and only use black and white.

The first step is to create a logo that would be put up right above the entrance of the department floor. In order for the brand to connect to the larger scope of the school, but also play on the idea that the department is subversive and rule-breaking, I took one of MICA’s iconic “Giza” typeface and decided to take apart the letters and reconstruct it into an entirely new typeface, playing into the idea of reusing and repurposing digital materials. By doing this, not only does this create interesting opportunities for modular type, but also give form to pattern-making, iconography and wayfinding (arrows). A large stencil would be fashioned so it can be used as a form of permanent signage for the floor but also as a substitute for exhibition signage in Bronze Gallery.

Choosing the body text came down to convenience, conservation of energy and accessibility. By choosing the default typeface native to InDesign and Illustrator, typefaces like “Minion Pro” and “Myriad Pro” can be used by anyone, anywhere. Not only do these 2 typefaces (especially “Minion Pro”) offer a wide number of weights, it also compliments the modular “Maker Giza” typeface. 

It might not seem as though choosing typefaces is something to be "sustainable" about, but the truth of the matter is that a main resource we unaccount for is time.  

Our main resource is time: if there is a way to save/conserve time, then its sustainable. Sustainability doesn't necessarily equate to resources
from a produciton standpoint 
Typeface choice is mainly arbitrary other than aesthetic differences. Removing this process

"Maker Giza" is named for the role of designer as maker. The notion of a "maker" is rooted in traditional crafts and practices, which is what "Maker Giza" aims to do through its subversion of signage and typographic treatment. 

By creating this identity, I hope to bring to light that sustainable measures in design can exist and substitute as healthy alternatives to what we think is the "right" way of doing design.
