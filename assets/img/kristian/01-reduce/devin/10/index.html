        <h3>We, the undersigned, attest:</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Humans have emptied the world of meaning.</strong> Our systems of value have destabilized. Civilization is beginning to crumble.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will not support the old world. We stand only for new beginnings.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will invest ourselves in the creation and discovery of new meaning. In all that we do we will attempt to pry the world back from the grasp of ideology and industry.
        </p>
