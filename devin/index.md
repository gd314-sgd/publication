## Contingencies in Sustainabilitism
This essay is a reflection on the contingencies we must acknowledge and address as designers (when I say "designer" I also invoke "artist" and "writer" and "engineer" — I invoke the idea of constrained problem-solving). I will reflect on these contingencies through the lens of digital product design, but the reflections I make apply to the entire domain of design (again, when I say "design," I invoke many other trades, crafts, specializations, and domains of knowledge). But first, we'll take a brief journey through the present state of the Internet.

Ted Nelson, a pioneering information technologist and philosopher who helped develop the directionality and ideological foundation of the early Internet, once wrote that "everything is deeply intertwingled." Nelson continues, tearing down the notion of "subjects of study":
 
> "In an important sense there are no 'subjects' at all; there is only all knowledge, since the cross-connections among the myriad topics of this world simply cannot be divided up neatly." 

This notion of the intersectionality of knowledge domains led Nelson to invent the concept of hypertext, which is the foundation of the Internet as we know it today: an entangled mass of documents that link to each other using hyperlinks in order to form a network of knowledge, and ultimately, a network of peers, of real people.

Today, the Internet is broken. This is because of the planetary-scale centralization of power, resources, and attention into just a few repositories that lie in the hands of global sovereign corporations like Facebook, Google, Twitter, and Amazon. A new Internet is needed, and calls for this new Internet have been answered by projects like the [InterPlanetary File System](https://ipfs.io/) and the [DAT Protocol](https://datproject.org/) — projects that aim to decentralize and dis-intermediate the web, reclaiming information, power, and attention from the hands of the central Internet powers.

The "intertwingularity" or entanglement of information in the world has been denied and slaughtered by the global Internet powers, which collect that information and force it into arbitrarily constructed ontologies, or structures. Accordingly, the interfaces through which we access and manipulate information have become centralized and turned into objects for the generation of capital — in short, interfaces and digital ontologies today exist not for the user's well-being and the freedom of information, but for the accruement of dollars. Additionally, these interfaces obscure the inherent materiality of the Web: the mass of roots supporting it that consists of real people, submarine cables and fiber optics, rare-earth metals, plastics, and more elusive material activities like labor, resource extraction, server maintenance, and energy usage. This is unacceptable: it is an abomination to the technology and ideology invented by Ted Nelson and Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web.

The alternative, the horizon of hope, lies in sustainability. 

Sustainability acknowledges inherently the intertwingularity of systems, things, people, information, and ideas. More than just "being green," which is a shallow interpretation of sustainability at best, sustainability is an endlessly intertwingled set of actions and ideologies that work together to form a sustainable existence. Even more than that, sustainability is the way we respond to the collision of individual and collective actions with the material circumstances of the world. Sustainability is an activity, not a decision — it requires continuous action and inquiry. Sustainability is difficult to define, but I'll give it a try: sustainability is the continuous act of questioning our contexts  and acting in response to those questions in a way that maintains equilibrium in the network of forces that compose our contexts. Put more succinctly, sustainability is asking questions and answering those questions with actions oriented toward a balanced and enriched future. This is opposed to unsustainability, which can be defined as any activity that depletes resources and throws off the equilibrium of the contexts surrounding us.

Design is the ultimate substrate for sustainability. Design is the act of asking questions in order to solve problems within a set of constraints. All the way through, the design process involves questioning and acting, observing and responding. It is through this observation and response, which forms a dialectic whose synthesis is a design artifact, that design can become a model of sustainability.

The sustainable designer, and the sustainable individual in general, always considers a web of questions before acting on an intuitive or intellectual impulse. They question things in categories such as environmental sustainability, fiscal sustainability, and individual sustainability (physical and mental well-being).

When designing, this question-asking is a crucial step in the design process, because the questions asked work to form the boundaries of the solution space, or the domain of possible solutions to the problem, and in turn work to construct the form of the derived design artifact. If the questions asked include questions of sustainability, the derived design artifact will likely be more sustainable than otherwise.

In the context of digital product design, sustainability is a tricky thing to define, and the questions we ask as product designers are difficult to think up. During Kristian Bjørnard's Sustainable Design course, I worked on redesigning aspects of a product I had previously designed for a client to make the project more sustainable. The product is a social wish list application called [BuyMeThis](https://buymethis.com/), where users can add products they want to lists and share those lists with others (for example, it could be used for a birthday gift wishlist or a wedding registry). I began the redesign process by asking myself the following questions:

- What does sustainability mean in the context of this project?
- How can the product be more individually sustainable, more mentally sustainable for the user?
- How can the product be made more environmentally friendly through design decisions?

These questions led me to the final question that drove my investigation: *How can the product encourage more responsible and sustainable consumption?* This question led to a set of product/design statements and questions which were answered by a set of design decisions.

- How can I encourage users to consume the application's content more slowly in order to respect their right to attention sustainability?
- How can I alter the functionality of the product in order to discourage unsustainable consumption?
- What behaviors am I trying to encourage or discourage in order to make sustainability a primary feature of the product?

These are the features I considered altering or introducing as a result of those questions:

- A suite of small features to discourage buying products from vendors that are known to have a higher footprint than others.
- Website/store hours, just like a real store, to discourage people from shopping 24/7 and using server energy at unnecessary times.
