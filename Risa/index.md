My project originally was to create a theoretical makeup brand that prioritized sustainablity. My goals for this makeup line were that it: 
1. Used natural/minimal/non-toxic products
2. Was cruelty free
3. used reduced-waste packaging
From looking at other brands, I came up with the specifics:

-square packaging for stackability

-bamboo casings

-biodegradable cardboard packaging

-natural/minimal ingredients

-fruit pigment?

-ethical pigment sourcing

-refills

I started designing a logo based on a brand that used bamboo casings for its products. Eventually, I decided I was wasting time designing a logo for a brand that didn't even extist; I starting thinking about how to make the bamboo idea more sustainable, or even find alternatives.

Makeup with "natural" ingredients tend to expire faster because of less chemical preservatives in the product. This was pointed out, and the idea was proposed to find containers that broke-down soon after the products started to expire.
