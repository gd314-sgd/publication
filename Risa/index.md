My project originally was to create a theoretical makeup brand that prioritized sustainablity. My original goals for this makeup line were that it: 

1. Used natural/minimal/non-toxic products
2. Was cruelty free
3. used reduced-waste packaging

From looking at other brands, I considered the specifics:

-square packaging for stackability

-bamboo casings

-biodegradable cardboard packaging

-natural/minimal ingredients

-fruit pigment?

-ethical pigment sourcing

-refills

I started designing a logo based on a brand called Elate that used bamboo casings for its products. I called it Uplift, and it was going to be a knock-off, slightly-better verson of Elate. Eventually, I decided I was wasting time designing a whole new logo for a brand that didn't even extist; I starting thinking about how to make the bamboo idea more sustainable, or even find alternatives.

Makeup with "natural" ingredients tend to expire faster because of less chemical preservatives in the product. This was pointed out, and the idea was proposed to find containers that broke-down soon after the products started to expire. I found Tomorrow Machine, a studio that created sugar-packaging for food products. The sugar packaging would slowly break-down, creating essentially no waste while effectively protecting the product.

I want to make clear that "eco-friendly" and "sustainable" are two different descriptions.

A brand like Alima Pure has an admirable dedication to animal cruelty and non-toxic products. According to their website: "Here you’ll find a list of all the ingredients used in Alima Pure cosmetics. Our products are free of parabens, sulfates, phthalates, dimethicone, petroleum, talc, bismuth oxychloride, and nanoparticles. They’re absolutely never tested on animals." 


What I didn't consider the specifics of in this project was: an inclusive shade-range, affordable pricing/budgeting to sustain a sustainable brand. Palm oil, powders have a longer shelf life than wet/cream products.

-way of life that doesn't prioritize brand names.
