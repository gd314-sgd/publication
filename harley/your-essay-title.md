Music is a daily part of my life. When Iâ€™m not in class, I listen to Spotify all day long. The form that music has taken in the casual American life has changed considerably in the past fifty years, from vinyls, cassettes, and CDs, to iPods, to streaming and subscription-based platforms.[^1]

Kyle Devine, Associate Professor at The University of Oslo, collaborated with Dr. Matt Brennan at the University of Glasgow on a research project called "The Cost of Music." They conducted research on archival data of music consumption and production in the US, comparing economic and environmental costs of different formats at different times. Brennan focused on the economics, while Devine focused on the environmental impact. "Intuitively, you might think that less physical product means far lower carbon emissions. Unfortunately, this is not the case," Devine says. Storing and processing music files in the cloud depends on vast data centers that use a tremendous amount of resources and energy. Kevin Devine translated plastic production and energy use to store and transmit digital files into greenhouse gas equivalents (GHGs). He compared the GHGs from recorded music in 1977, 1988, 

Devine translated plastic productions and the electricity use to store and transmit digital audio files into greenhouse gas equivalents (GHGs). He then compared the GHGs from recorded music in the US in 1977, 1988, 2000 and 2016.

The findings are clear. The GHGs caused by recorded music are much higher today than in the past. In 1977 the GHGs from, recorded music were 140 million kg. By 2016, they were estimated to somewhere between 200 million kg and over 350 million kg.

The researchers found that the price consumers pay for recorded music has decreased dramatically. In 1977, consumers were willing to pay roughly 4.83 % of their average weekly salary for a vinyl album. In 2013, this number is down to roughly 1.22% of the equivalent salary for a digital album in 2013.
