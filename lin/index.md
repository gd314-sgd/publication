# RETURN -- The flourish of Ecology and Humanity 

When we keep running rapidly, sometimes we should slow down and look back towards the point where we started, especially while we can see there're full of dangers ahead that feel not like what we expected before. Maybe we can think about changing our direction to correct it and question ourselves, what if our destination, is in the opposite way?


The RETURN project so far includes 3 part.
- 1.The methodology map.
- 2.The research & practice of sustainable cleaning 
- 3.A plan for application in a Chinese nature reserve and community




## The methodology map

I will explain it by answering the following questions:

1. How to be sustainable?

_Plant a tree_ 

2. What do you want to sustain?

_Choose a seed_ 

3. Why flourish?

_For happiness_ 

4. How to flourish?

_Diversity & balance_ 

5. Conclusion

- 1.5 Time & Size Scales
- 1.6 Finding advantages
- 1.7 What can we do now?
- 1.8 Finding shortages
- 1.9 Testing prototypes
- 1.10 Ten rules


1.1 The Environment of Design

The environment decides what kinds of trees will be able to survive.

Each design is run by people for the audience, at some place and some time. They're the 5W questions of design -- who, where, when, what and why. In order to let our design survive, it's worthy to spend a lot on the previous research and make decisions according to the facts and the available recourses we find, as much as we can.


1.2 Ecology System

Geography is the foundation which decides what kinds of natural resources there are and nature will use them economically. All the systems are combined and share the materials. They run in loops to let the limited materials sustain. What's more, there're the variation and iteration to keep improving the changeable systems.

If designs exist in this physical world, they have to take some materials and turn into something for designers' reasons.


1.3 Humanity System

People's mind is the foundation of our system. Our bodies are born from nature so the rules of Ecology system work on us as well and there's no big difference.

In artificial designs, we work with stakeholders for our audiences whom we choose. And we make design decisions by our value or according to audiences' willings from cultures. The economy is also about making decisions, for we have limited resources but endless needs. So you always have to give up something for gaining something else. Competitive markets make choices for us. As Marxist said, ' Base and superstructure', politics influence our designs very much. We should know and understand the policy and search for useful resources for us. Governments are surely included in our stakeholders.


1.4 Why & So what

We find pieces of facts through a large amount of work on research, but not enough. With this disordered information, we need to connect and order them by asking why and so what.

And asking a few times is not enough as well. It's very uncomfortable, painful and cruel as Devin said(He described it clearly in his project. ) but we have to repeat the 2 questions endlessly. Because you will find every time you get different answers and it's hard to tell what are appropriate truly.

In addition, ask 'why' before 'so what'. It's very easy that we jump into designing the solution of problems instead of understanding how they were caused. Your solutions might work for a while but lose function quickly because they don't touch 'nature'. 


1.5 Time & Size Scales

Asking in different kinds of scales of time and sizes can help us think from all angles. 

In time, the history of the object is very important. Because things happen in circulations so it might already happen before. It will save us a lot if we spend enough on the previous. But the solution worked before doesn't mean it will work for now and the future. That can be our reference but of course, we can not just copy it. It's very easy that we follow the traditional ways expecting to solve the changeable problems. 

In sizes, different scales of designs need different volumes of resource and impact with different degrees. 


1.6 Finding advantages

There're problems everywhere and all the time. For most situations, we can do nothing at all. It's great to realize don't try to tackle something when we don't have the ability to. Just do your part as best as you can.

But changing small things with our limited capacity can also make a difference, especially if they're the keys.

We have to keep positive among those disappointing facts and design hopes and win-win.


1.7 What can we do now?

Finally, we can decide what we can design by answering the 5W questions with great efforts on research. As you can see, we are just at the halfway point but it's the beginning of our influence to systems. 

Next, we need to be more brave yet careful for we're going to gain and lose physically in this material world of conservation, by action research.


1.8 Finding shortages

When we are very optimistic about how we are going to change the world and save the planet, it's time to hold on and reflect the challenges that hiding behind the opportunities we find. To calculate the risks, costs, and effects in different time and size scales as well as on different people. 

These reflections can protect others and us.


1.9 Testing prototypes

To make a difference we have to take risks and pay for it, but we can make more appropriate choices after reflection ,or still can't. In case hurting others and ourselves, we can make a small step first, quickly and easily. Then to walk step by step until we can run. 

If we fall, we can have a rest to think about it and then get up again while correcting our direction from time to time by GPS, just in case you are running into the wrong way by a slight deviation in the beginning.

Only after we practice what we learn from the previous research, we can see things are often totally different from our common sense and research.

Our designs might be changed completely in the future, in functions or efficiency. They can be far out of our expects when it spread furtherly.

Then we can keep questioning 'why' and 'so what' about them, and start another loop.


1.10 Ten rules

The 10 suggestions are also combined with each other and we need to apply them all at the same time.



The whole process is complex, tough and cruel, therefore nothing comes easily. Every existence is a unique miracle already.


Yet it's far not enough if we want to do something good.




### 2. What do you want to sustain?

There’s nothing new under the sun.

The methodology already used widely everywhere. I just illustrated and explain it as a designer but everyone is a designer because we all want to sustain something. 

Fortune, fame, power, relationship, life….

I think the business uses it first and has done very well, especially the internet companies. That’s why they can make popular products that are so easy for users and satisfy them so much that they can not refuse it. And they are proud of what they have done by saying ' We create needs. That's a real innovation. '

That’s how they make money from utilizing nature and humanity. 

They built a whole enormous and cumbersome system to support it depending on the natural resource that looks like endless, exploiting loopholes and sending people to involve, by designing things that should be known invisible and educating us in their ways. 

There’s a Goebbels effect. It means when you repeat the fake thousands of times, then they become, the ‘ truth '.

In their way, things run kind of well in those systems but there's fear all the time, for it's clearly unsustainable. For it's opposite from nature's direction.

Therefore, the methodology map is just a tool and way. To use it in what directions depends on you.  



### 3. Why flourish?

### 4. How to flourish?

### 5. Conclusion

Thanks for spending time reading. Since this class is called Sustainable Graphic Design, my conclusion about what the mission of graphic designers is ---


As visual designers, 
to visualize the invisible.

Show them,
so that people can realize.
