# RETURN -- The flourish of Ecology and Humanity 

When we keep running rapidly, sometimes we should slow down and look back towards the point where we started, especially while we can see there're full of dangers ahead that feel not like what we expected before. Maybe we can think about changing our direction to correct it and question ourselves, what if our destination, is in the opposite way?


The RETURN project so far includes 3 part.
- 1.The methodology map.
- 2.The research & practice of sustainable cleaning 
- 3.A plan for application in a Chinese nature reserve and community




## The methodology map

I will explain it by answering the following questions:

1. How to be sustainable?

_Plant a tree_ 

2. What do you want to sustain?

_Choose a seed_ 

3. Why flourish?

_For happiness_ 

4. How to flourish?

_Diversity & balance_ 

5. Conclusion



### 1. How to be sustainable?
- 1.1 The Environment of Design
- 1.2 Ecology System
- 1.3 Humanity System
- 1.4 Why & So what
- 1.5 Time & Size Scales
- 1.6 Finding advantages
- 1.7 What can we do now?
- 1.8 Finding shortages
- 1.9 Testing prototypes
- 1.10 Ten rules


- 1.1 The Environment of Design
The environment decides what kinds of trees will be able to survive.
Each design is run by people for the audience, at some place and some time. They're the 5W questions of design -- who, where, when, what and why. In order to let our design survive, it's worthy to spend a lot on the previous research and make decisions according to the facts and the available recourses we find, as much as we can.

- 1.2 Ecology System
Geography is the foundation which decides what kinds of natural resources there are and nature will use them economically. All the systems are combined and share the materials. They run in loops to let the limited materials sustain. What's more, there're the variation and iteration to keep improving the changeable systems.
If designs exist in this physical world, they have to take some materials and turn into something for designers' reasons.

- 1.3 Humanity System
People's mind is the foundation of our system. Our bodies are born from nature so the rules of Ecology system work on us as well and there's no big difference.
In artificial designs, we work with stakeholders for our audiences whom we choose. And we make design decisions by our value or according to audiences' willings from cultures. The economy is also about making decisions, for we have limited resources but endless needs. So you always have to give up something for gaining something else. Competitive markets make choices for us. As Marxist said, ' Base and superstructure', politics influence our designs very much. We should know and understand the policy and search for useful resources for us. Governments are surely included in our stakeholders.

### 3. Why flourish?

### 4. How to flourish?

### 5. Conclusion

Thanks for spending time reading. Since this class is called Sustainable Graphic Design, my conclusion about what the mission of graphic designers is ---

As visual designers, 
to visualize the invisible.
Show them,
so that people can realize.
