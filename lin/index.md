# RETURN -- The flourish of Ecology and Humanity 

When we keep running rapidly, sometimes we should slow down and look back towards the point where we started, especially while we can see there're full of dangers ahead that feel not like what we expected before. Maybe we can think about changing our direction to correct it and question ourselves, what if our destination, is in the opposite way?

The RETURN project so far includes 3 part.
1.The methodology map.
2.The research & practice of sustainable cleaning 
3.A plan for application in a Chinese nature reserve and community

**This will be bold text!** and _This_ or _this_ will be Italic Text!

[And! anything you put in brackets](1) will be a link (you need the parenthesis at the end of the brackets.)

## The methodology map
I will explain it by answering the following question:
1. How to be sustainable?
_Plant a tree_ 
2. What do you want to sustain?
_Choose a seed_ 
3. Why flourish?
_For happiness_ 
4. How to be flourishing?
_Diversity & balance _ 

### How to be sustainable?

Any type that you type is treated as a plain paragraph.

You need to double return paragraphs. If you don't double return it will see this as just the next sentence of the previous paragraph.

- This is a list
- you just put a hyphen or an asterix
- at the beginning of a line to make it see things as list items

1. A numbered list is the same
1. just put numbers
