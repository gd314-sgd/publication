# Ground Up Sustainability Design Update
## Why did you pick this project to improve?
School projects often ignore real life implications that arise through the process of making and implementing. It’s easy to dream too big, deeming your work unachievable in the context of real life. For my project I wanted to take a school project and turn it into something achievable. Something I could actually produce and share with the world beyond my portfolio.

## what were you trying to sustainabilitize?
My project was to create my own imaginary art school. As you can imagine, it would be easy for me to blow this idea out of proportion. At first, I started to imagine what it would be like to create a school like the Bauhaus. A physical space where students would learn within. My schools program was focused on hip-hop. It was called Ground-Up and involved a physical space built in impoverished neighborhoods where students would have the most benefit. I designed a school curriculum, came up with a book series and different projects the students would participate in. It was all great, but in the end, lacked real life implications of anything I could actually produce. This left me with a goal, how could I make something accessible to all?

## how did you go about analyzing your project for possibilities?
After considering all the different parameters of what a school is, and considering the fact I wanted to actually make this thing real. I started considering what tools I could utilize at school. I thought about the different tools and techniques people learn, who my target audience is, and what I could do that hasn’t been done before.

## what questions did you ask? (what did you keep asking as the project progressed?)
Who is my target audience?
What makes the most sense in the context of hip-hop as a platform for learning and teaching?
How can I use minimal resources?
How is a school defined?
How can this feel authentic to hip-hop culture?
What can I do at MICA?
How can I utilize the curriculum of my other classes to cross pollinate into this project. In other words how can I steer all of my classes to help benefit my interest in this idea and focus my energy on making something meaningful?
What are all the different ways you can achieve a goal and what is achievable?
What makes my solution the best one?
Who will be reading the zine and what is the end goal?
What do you want sophomores to read to understand?
How can you conceptualize your work to be more sustainable?
How can this lead to a more sustainable process in your work making in school?


## where did you look for answers?
I scoured the internet, read books, went to b-boy practice and asked my community. I tried to identify innovative learning methods that utilize technology, in turn, minimizing resources. Identifying as a b-boy since the age of 14, I thought about how I learned. I looked at my favorite albums and analyzed the visual language of hip-hop. I thought about what hip-hop means to me and what it could do for society.

## what did you learn?
I learned that hip-hop is best learned in your home, and out in the community where it flourishes. You learn by going out and being an active participant in the culture.

Resources for learning should encourage students to seek out knowledge by engaging and being an active participant to the conversation. Hiphop gives an individual a sense of belonging and interacting with the outside world.


## what resources did you find?
There are a lot of youtube videos, documentaries, and books on hip-hop.

## what do you know now that would have made your life easier at the beginning? (or what things that you figured out would be good to have given yourself when you were a first year or sophomore?)

## what other projects or examples did you look at for inspiration?

## any images or in process examples you can provide?

## if you're finishing the project; can you provide final documentation?
