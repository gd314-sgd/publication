# My Main Title

This is Devin's change Adding a starter paragraph so that we can commit a new change.

**This will be bold text!** and _This_ or _this_ will be Italic Text!

[And! anything you put in brackets](1) will be a link (you need the parenthesis at the end of the brackets.)

## A subhead

### A sub-subhead...

Any type that you type is treated as a plain paragraph.

You need to double return paragraphs. If you don't double return it will see this as just the next sentence of the previous paragraph.

- This is a list
- you just put a hyphen or an asterix
- at the beginning of a line to make it see things as list items

1. A numbered list is the same
1. just put numbers
