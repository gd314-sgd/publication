## A subhead

### A sub-subhead...

Any type that you type is treated as a plain paragraph.

You need to double return paragraphs. If you don't double return it will see this as just the next sentence of the previous paragraph.

- This is a list
- you just put a hyphen or an asterix
- at the beginning of a line to make it see things as list items

- A numbered list is the same

- just put numbers
