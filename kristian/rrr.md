# Reduce, Reuse, Recycle: Strategies for Designing?

## Waste = Food
We kicked off the term with a reading from _Cradle to Cradle_ with the premise that waste is a problematic concept. Nature produces no waste; outputs from one system are always inputs for another. Our current design and consumer cultures do not operate in this way. Karrie Jacobs in her essay _NAME_ points this out very clearlyâ€¦ Designers make garbage.

To try and internalize this students were given RRR as a set of design prompts.

## Reduce
(collect everyone's reductions)

## Reuse
(take picutres (scans???) of the reused poster constructions)

## Recycle
(show off recycled things; discuss shared drive and how else that might work?)

## Conclusion?
