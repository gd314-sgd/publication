# Reduce, Reuse, Recycle: Strategies for Designing?

## Waste = Food
We kicked off the term with a reading from _Cradle to Cradle_ with the premise that waste is a problematic concept. Nature produces no waste; outputs from one system are always inputs for another. Our current design and consumer cultures do not operate in this way. Karrie Jacobs in her essay _NAME_ points this out very clearlyâ€¦ Designers make garbage.

To try and internalize this students were given RRR as a set of design prompts.

The three Rs (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle) have been an imporant aspect of the environmental ... How can we use the 3 Rs as design strategies?

## Reduce
(collect everyone's reductions)
Our "reduce" exercise asked students to choose a poster or other project and think about how to "reduce" it. This could mean reducing its size, its color palette, its amount of content, etc. And how can you do that reduction in granular steps. Show us how that reduction plays out. 

## Reuse
(take picutres (scans???) of the reused poster constructions)
Reuse is a normal process in many fields. As graphic designers however, its not the most common methodology. We chose to apply the idea of material reuse to poster designing. students were asked to bring in old prints and we would make new aphoristic posters with or old work.

## Recycle
(show off recycled things; discuss shared drive and how else that might work?)
Recycling we tried to take in a new direction. The important idea of recycling is that you take a material and return it to its raw state. This is fundamentally different than reuse. How does one explore the "raw materials" of grpahic desigin? how does one return a poster or similar to its raw materials? Students collected past projects -- visuals, typefaces, etc. -- and we shared them all with each other. We then made new aphoristic posters recycling each other's "raw materials."

## Conclusion?
Why was/is this useful? what other questions does this raise?
