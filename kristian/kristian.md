I am an educator, a designer, a farmer, a cyclist -- a sustainabilitist -- I try to sustainabilitize as much as I can. I design in a way that accounts for the interconnectedness of all things; with tools that maximize liberty; that create freer culture (vernacular buildable and usable by anyone) … Professing Design; Producing Signs on Substrates; Pedaling profusely.
