The three Rs (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle[^3R] (Not to be confused with Reading, Writing, & Arith
metic)) have been an imporant aspect of the environmental ... How can we use the 3 Rs as design strategies?

## Waste = Food
As a premise, "Waste = Food" has been most contemporanesouly popularized through _Cradle to Cradle_.[^c2c] Michael Braungart and William McDonough want us to understand that our concepting of waste is incorrect; we have a problematic relationship with waste. Nature produces no waste; outputs from one system are always inputs for another. Our current design and consumer cultures do not operate in this way. Karrie Jacobs points this out quite bluntly in her essay _Disposability, Graphic Design, Style, and Waste_: designers make garbage. Waste is just what we make -- our inputs have only one output, trash! And trash must be sent away; not used for making more design.

To try and internalize this students were given "Reduce, Reuse, Recycle" as a set of design prompts.

Reduction asks to think about different ways of minimizing. Reuse looks at how to use what we have to do more. Recycle questions the regular way of manufature. How do we utlie our materials an manmufactirig items. How do we take finished products back to raw materials for new designs?

Reduce helps us with the waste side of our equation. Reuse and Rcycle help our previous waste befome new food. How can our creative waste from one design process become food for others?

wate = food, everything is connected.

## Reduce
(collect everyone's reductions)
REduce means to minimize outputs, conserve inputs, utilize tact adn strategy in th form, the content, the quantitites. 

Our "reduce" exercise asked students to choose a poster or other project and think about how to "reduce" it. This could mean reducing its size, its color palette, its amount of content, etc. And how can you do that reduction in granular steps. Show us how that reduction plays out. 

Strategies for lessening material and energy impacts.

Less materials, less energy, less choices, less [...]

How far can you reduce? do you have to make things at all?

What are the impediments to reducing?

Reduce form. Reduce content. Reduce colors. Reduce size. Reduce number of typefaces. Reduce nodes on a vector path. Reduce hierarchy.

Is minimalism the most "sustainable" aesthetic then?[^minimal]

so, reduce can lead you two a mental mind set

## Reuse
(take pictures (scans???) of the reused poster constructions)
Reuse is a normal process in many fields. As graphic designers however, its not the most common methodology. We chose to apply the idea of material reuse to poster designing. students were asked to bring in old prints and we would make new aphoristic posters with or old work.

Strategies for making solutions last longer and finding other uses when finished.

Reuse focuses on materials in their present state. Reuse is using stuff as it is but for a new purpose.

Reuse should constitute less work and less energy than recycling.

Reuse â‰  Recycling

What are the impediments to reuse?

What can we reuse in design?

How can reuse be made conceptually useful?

## Recycle
(show off recycled things; discuss shared drive and how else that might work?)
Recycling we tried to take in a new direction. The important idea of recycling is that you take a material and return it to its raw state. This is fundamentally different than reuse. How does one explore the "raw materials" of grpahic desigin? how does one return a poster or similar to its raw materials? Students collected past projects -- visuals, typefaces, etc. -- and we shared them all with each other. We then made new aphoristic posters recycling each other's "raw materials."

What are the raw amterials of a design that can be reclaimed to make design anew? Type? Color? Image? Shape?

Strategies for reclaiming as much residual value as possible and preventing virgin materials from needlessly being used

Return a manufactured, processed material back into a raw material.

Recycling implies taking something back to an initial, raw, pure state and then creating fresh, new things from the "renewed" raw material. This can be high energy; high effort.

When you can't reduce and you can't reuse then you recycle. It is meant to be a last resort.

What are impediments to recycling?

What are the raw materials of graphic design?

Can we make recycling conceptually useful?

## Conclusion?
Why was/is this useful? what other questions does this raise?

When you recite the three R's, they are in an intentional order -- easiest to hardest; pre- to post-; low input to high input.
